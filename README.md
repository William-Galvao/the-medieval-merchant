# the-medieval-merchant

This was my first project as an **Ironhack bootcamp** student.

The challenge was to create a game in just one week and using only **HTML, CSS and raw javascript**.

So I decided to create not just any game, but an original game unlike anything I had ever played before.

The Medieval Merchant is a buy and sell simulation set in a medieval RPG universe.

The goal is to observe changes in seasonality to make as much profit as possible.

Available items and conditions affecting the market are randomly generated making each game a unique experience.
